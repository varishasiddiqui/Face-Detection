# Face-Detection
A high-precision face detection system implemented using MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) that processes static images to identify faces with 95%+ confidence. The system detects facial  bounding boxes and identifies 5 key facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth corners).
